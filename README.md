# Recursion_practice
 -Uses python turtle. I'm going to try to practice recursion with this library.
 
 -Requirements: Python 3 and the Turtle Library installed. Also requires the random library. 
 
 -Recommendations: I would use repl.it or some IDE with the turtle library as you will not be able to see the turtle if you don't do so. You will also need a console to display  some of the code and you may need to setup up a turtle environment if you are using another IDE besides repl.it such as Visual studio or Pycharm.
